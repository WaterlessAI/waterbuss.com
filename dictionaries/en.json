This AI water footprint varies significantly based on the model complexity (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5), the location of the data center, and the local Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of the cooling infrastructure."

            "a": "Training and running Large Language Models (LLMs) generates massive thermal energy. To prevent hardware failure, data centers use evaporative cooling towers. This process dissipates heat by evaporating clean water into the atmosphere. Additionally, the electricity generation required to power these GPUs carries a significant indirect water footprint at the source."

As data center water usage 2026 projections show exponential growth, initiatives like Waterbuss aim to provide transparency into the Sustainable computing metrics required for responsible AI deployment and global resource management."
